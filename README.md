## MVI - Model View Intend with Kotlin Flow
Model View Intend builds upon Unidirectional Data Flow, better organizing the UI and business logic into view states and creating a clear contract between UI and business logic with an interface.

- Ui Modularization : Define the final UI results emitted and rendered in an interface contract and view state.
- Scaling: Reuse code with clear organization.
- Unit test simply: Build tests by observing the existing view state results from the business logic.
- Kotlin Flow: Quick setup, lifecycle management, threading management, avoid nesting, open for customization and simple implementation.
